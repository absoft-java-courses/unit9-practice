HOMEWORK

Go to the com.absoft.unit9homework.Runner to the run method. Execute this class and pay attention on the output.
You might see output like "Unfortunately you still have 10 error(s) =c".

Pay attention on methods like callTask1, callTask2 and callTask3. These methods have some 'validations' and comments what you have to do.
Do the tasks from comments. If everything is OK then you don't have the following output: "Congads! you don't have any errors.".

Also, you can find some optional task Card and BankAccount classes.
